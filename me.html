                                    Muhammad Asjad's journey began on the 7th of December, 2003, in the picturesque town of
                                    Kanata, Ontario, where he was born into a family deeply connected to the world of 
                                    programming. His introduction to the fascinating realm of coding came through his father, a 
                                    skilled computer programmer who ignited his curiosity.
                                   <br> <br>
                                    From an early age, Asjad's education took root in a structured environment at a religious 
                                    institution. The foundations of his education were instrumental in cultivating not only his time 
                                    management skills but also his burgeoning passion for mathematics. This early spark 
                                    gradually transformed into an unwavering desire to dive into the intricate world of computer 
                                    programming. His fervent love for video games, with their boundless potential for creativity, 
                                    steered him toward a career path as a game programmer.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Throughout his journey into the world of game programming, Asjad honed his proficiency in 
                                    various programming languages, with C++ standing out prominently. He embarked on a 
                                    diverse array of projects, ranging from crafting a unique vertical version of the iconic Flappy 
                                    Bird to weaving captivating narratives in text-based RPGs. He also tackled recreations of 
                                    popular games like Simon Says and Frogger using SDL. His coding odyssey was marked by
                                    an array of challenges that put his patience and determination to the test. Through 
                                    unwavering dedication and rigorous problem-solving, he overcame these obstacles, gaining 
                                    valuable insights into effective project management and further refining his time 
                                    management skills.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    Asjad's expertise extends beyond coding, encompassing the realms of pixel art and video 
                                    editing. While these skills serve as outlets for his creativity, coding remains his sanctuary, 
                                    where the gratification of a well-executed code fuels his passion. His remarkable aptitude for
                                    time management allows him to dissect complex tasks into manageable components, 
                                    ensuring they are completed in a timely and efficient manner. His steadfast aspiration is to 
                                    create a game that not only reflects his creative vision but also resonates with players, 
                                    leaving an enduring mark on the gaming landscape.
                                    <br> <br>
                                    In his ongoing journey through the captivating terrain of programming, Asjad remains 
                                    optimistic and eagerly anticipates the day when his passion materialises, giving rise to 
                                    innovative and impactful games that will captivate and inspire players.</p>
